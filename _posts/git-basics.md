I just came on-board a spanking new startup as the CTO.
Fortunately/unfortunately, we have a few folks who are very young. Since they are young,
they haven't yet developed a sense of "this is how we do things". This is a great thing!
On the other hand, they don't have a lot of experience working in teams and especially
fast-moving ones like this.

For their benefit, I ended up creating a short presentation on Git and how to use
it within the team. I'm sharing that here in the hope that some poor soul out there
will benefit from it.
